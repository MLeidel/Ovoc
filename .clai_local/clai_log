how to install play on Linux

ASSISTANT:
Do you mean Play Framework (the web framework for Scala/Java) or the Play media player? I’ll assume you mean Play Framework. If you meant the other, tell me and I’ll adjust.

Option A: Install the standalone Play command (the “play” tool)

Prereqs:
- Java JDK 8+ (OpenJDK is fine). Example on Debian/Ubuntu:
  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk
  - java -version

Steps:
1) Download the Linux distribution from the Play Framework downloads page (look for a Linux tarball/zip, e.g., play-2.x.x-linux-x64.zip).

2) Extract and install:
- sudo mkdir -p /opt
- sudo unzip -d /opt play-2.x.x-linux-x64.zip   (or tar -xzf play-2.x.x-linux-x64.tgz)

3) Create a convenient symlink and add to PATH:
- sudo ln -s /opt/play-2.x.x /opt/play
- echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/play/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
- source ~/.bashrc

4) Verify:
- play help

5) Create and run an app:
- play new my-app
- cd my-app
- play run

Notes:
- The Play command is being superseded by sbt-based workflows, but the standalone play tool is still available in many releases.

Option B: Use sbt (recommended for modern Play development)

Prereqs:
- Java JDK 8+ (as above)
- sbt (the Scala Build Tool)

Install sbt (example for Debian/Ubuntu):
- echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
- curl -sL https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x99E82A75642AC823 | sudo apt-key add -
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install sbt

Create a new Play project (seed templates):
- sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8   (for Scala) or
  sbt new playframework/play-java-seed.g8        (for Java)

Follow the prompts to name the project, then:
- cd your-app
- sbt run
- Open http://localhost:9000 in your browser

Notes:
- This is the current recommended workflow: manage Play projects with sbt rather than a separate “play” command.
- You can also create seeds with the Play Scala/Java templates and then customize.

Docker option (alternative):
- If you just want an isolated environment, you can run Play inside a Docker image (there are official images with JDK and sbt). This avoids host Java and sbt setup.

If you meant a different “Play” (e.g., a video player), tell me which Linux distro you’re on and whether you want a package manager install or a container-based approach, and I’ll tailor the steps.
