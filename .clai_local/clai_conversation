    "content": "Do you mean Play Framework (the web framework for Scala/Java) or the Play media player? I’ll assume you mean Play Framework. If you meant the other, tell me and I’ll adjust.\n\nOption A: Install the standalone Play command (the “play” tool)\n\nPrereqs:\n- Java JDK 8+ (OpenJDK is fine). Example on Debian/Ubuntu:\n  - sudo apt update\n  - sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk\n  - java -version\n\nSteps:\n1) Download the Linux distribution from the Play Framework downloads page (look for a Linux tarball/zip, e.g., play-2.x.x-linux-x64.zip).\n\n2) Extract and install:\n- sudo mkdir -p /opt\n- sudo unzip -d /opt play-2.x.x-linux-x64.zip   (or tar -xzf play-2.x.x-linux-x64.tgz)\n\n3) Create a convenient symlink and add to PATH:\n- sudo ln -s /opt/play-2.x.x /opt/play\n- echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/play/bin' >> ~/.bashrc\n- source ~/.bashrc\n\n4) Verify:\n- play help\n\n5) Create and run an app:\n- play new my-app\n- cd my-app\n- play run\n\nNotes:\n- The Play command is being superseded by sbt-based workflows, but the standalone play tool is still available in many releases.\n\nOption B: Use sbt (recommended for modern Play development)\n\nPrereqs:\n- Java JDK 8+ (as above)\n- sbt (the Scala Build Tool)\n\nInstall sbt (example for Debian/Ubuntu):\n- echo \"deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian all main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list\n- curl -sL https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x99E82A75642AC823 | sudo apt-key add -\n- sudo apt-get update\n- sudo apt-get install sbt\n\nCreate a new Play project (seed templates):\n- sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8   (for Scala) or\n  sbt new playframework/play-java-seed.g8        (for Java)\n\nFollow the prompts to name the project, then:\n- cd your-app\n- sbt run\n- Open http://localhost:9000 in your browser\n\nNotes:\n- This is the current recommended workflow: manage Play projects with sbt rather than a separate “play” command.\n- You can also create seeds with the Play Scala/Java templates and then customize.\n\nDocker option (alternative):\n- If you just want an isolated environment, you can run Play inside a Docker image (there are official images with JDK and sbt). This avoids host Java and sbt setup.\n\nIf you meant a different “Play” (e.g., a video player), tell me which Linux distro you’re on and whether you want a package manager install or a container-based approach, and I’ll tailor the steps."
